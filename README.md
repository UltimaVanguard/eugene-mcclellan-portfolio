## Description

The code refactor for Horiseon is to update Horiseon's website to be more accessible. As well as update the code to be more readable by adding semantic elements. I also updated the CSS to be more readable by restructuring the file and removing some of the redundancies.

You can view the HTML to see the semantic elements I added and look through CSS to see how I restructured it. I also added comments in both files to help understand the flow and what is happening in each section.
