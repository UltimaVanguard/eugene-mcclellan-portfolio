# eugene-mcclellan-portfolio

## Description

I am creating a portfolio website as a place to store the work I create in a central location and as a way to easily link employers to my work. I also used this as a test for myself on trying a mobile-first approach.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can access the website using https://ultimavanguard.github.io/eugene-mcclellan-portfolio/ this link.

The website will resize appropriately depending on screen size.

You can click on the three links on the header to take you the appropriate sections.

You're also able click on the images of my work to be taken to the deployed application to view it's functionality.

Finally, the email contact link will let you email me, and the github link will take you to my github page.
